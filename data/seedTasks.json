Florida's constitution provides that 'no tax shall be levied except in pursuance of law.' Art. VII, § 1(a), Fla. Const. From this it follows that property taxes are 'of a purely statutory nature which can be levied, assessed and collected only as provided by statute.' State ex. rel. Seaboard Airline Railway Co. v. Gay, 160 Fla. 445, 35 So.2d 403 (1948). An assessment not authorized by statute is void. Lewis State Bank v. Bridges, 115 Fla. 784, 156 So. 144 (1934). At the time Hausman conducted these assessments, the Florida time share statutes provided: Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, either expressed or implied, to the contrary, it is the legislative intent that nothing herein be deemed to alter the existing procedure for the assessment and collection of ad valorem taxes on accommodations or facilities subject to a time-sharing plan. § 721.03(3), Fla. Stat. (1981). Since VTSI's time shares were created in condominium facilities, they should have been assessed accordingly. The Florida Condominium Act provides in part that '[e]ach condominium parcel shall be separately assessed for ad valorem taxes and special assessments as a single parcel.' § 718.120(1), Fla. Stat. (1981). The existing statutes did not authorize Hausman to appraise the partial time share interests created in VTSI's condominium units. Due to this lack of authority, the trial court correctly concluded that Hausman's appraisal based on the value of the unit weeks was unlawful.",
        "output": "Hausman did not have the authority to separately appraise each unit week. According to Florida statutes, time share estates should be assessed as single condominium parcels, and there was no statutory authorization for appraising partial time share interests separately.

Also, Sauer asserted that plaintiff's allegations of gross negligence failed to establish conduct so reckless as to show a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury resulted, MCL 691.1407(2)(c); MSA 3.996(107)(2)(c), and, therefore, plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trial court reluctantly granted Sauer's motion for summary disposition upon finding that Sauer was a governmental employee. That finding was based on the fact that he worked for MSU and was acting within the scope of his employment when he examined and operated on Janet Vargo because residents under Sauer's tutelage were involved in this case and, as part of his employment, Sauer must maintain his medical skills as well as teach residents. The court also found that because plaintiff failed to allege facts amounting to gross negligence and no proprietary function was involved, Sauer was entitled to summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10).",

No repeal of 932b was affected by 46.02 with regard to this provision. Concomitantly, respondent argues that the only change 46.02 made in section 2 of 932b was the obligation on the superintendent when he was of the opinion that the patient adjudged criminally insane had regained his sanity. Respondent concedes that under 932b a patient adjudged criminally insane had recourse to Article 5547-82 of the Mental Health Code to petition for his discharge and to obtain a hearing on such petition. Although no reported cases address themselves to the propriety of this implied statutory authority in 932b, Eidinoff did pursue this course in the county court of Cherokee County to a judgment on the merits of his petition. The county court entertained the lawsuit and no effort was made by the state to oppose the petition on jurisdictional grounds. This court accordingly accepts the proposition that under 932b a patient adjudged criminally insane had recourse to the Mental Health Code to obtain a restoration of sanity hearing.",

Despite this change, patients committed under Article 932b, like Eidinoff, retain the right to seek release through civil proceedings under Article 5547-82 of the Mental Health Code, as the new statute did not eliminate this remedy."

He further determined that the Commissioner, in computing the offset applicable from August 1993 through February 1995, properly relied on the weekly rate of $418.27 specified in the original addendum to Plaintiff's July 20, 1993, lump sum settlement agreement. The ALJ also found that the Commissioner was not bound by the later, April 14, 1994, addendum, and that Plaintiff's disability insurance benefits would be subject to offset with the month he attained age 62. R. 12-20.",

Sec. 1144(a). Because Congress intended the regulation of employee benefit plans to be exclusively a federal concern, the Supreme Court has broadly interpreted the 'relate to' language of Section 1144(a) as encompassing any state law that has a 'connection with or reference to' employee benefit plans. Thus ERISA preempts all state laws insofar as they apply to employee benefit plans even if those laws do not expressly concern employee benefit plans and amount only to indirect regulation of such plans.",

Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People (see People v Fox, 124 AD3d 1252, 1253 [4th Dept 2015]), the factfinder could have reasonably concluded that defendant and the man alleged by defendant to have shot the victim shared 'a common purpose and a collective objective' (see People v Cabey, 85 NY2d 417, 422 [1995]), and that defendant 'shared in the intention of' the shooter (People v Morris, 229 AD2d 451, 451 [2d Dept 1996], lv denied 88 NY2d 990 [1996]).",
